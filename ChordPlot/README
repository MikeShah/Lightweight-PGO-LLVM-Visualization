Built using Processing 3.0b3 (Any later version will likely work)

If you have trouble building this on Linux:

Read the associated notes here:
(These notes explain about downloading an appropriate version of Java and not using OpenJDK).
https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Supported-Platforms

External Dependencies:
-This program relies on the ControlP5 Library. It itself is implemented in Processing and can be installed by
 going to Sketch->Import Library->Add Library ControlP5

- You need to run mymodulepass2 (name subject to change) to generate a dot file with appropriate meta-data as of 8/17/15.
  In theory any dot file will at least give you a microarray with the callsites.

Optional:
- I recommend using visualvm (apt-get visualvm) on Ubuntu for doing development.



Input Formats
- For now the input format is .dot file


Output Formats
- None currently. Perhaps .dot file for selected nodes in the future.


Making improvements:

grep -r -e "TODO" --include="*.pde"
grep -r -e "FIXME" --include="*.pde"
grep -r -e "DEPRECATE" --include="*.pde"
